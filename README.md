# SPS@UCF Python Intro Physics Solver (PIPS)
----------------------------------------------------------

## Overview
The Python Intro Physics Solver (PIPS) is designed to work as a basic model for introductory level physics problems. Uniting newtonian physics and basic electricity and magnetism. It is as simple as plugging in the problem you have then the solution will be plotted for you to visually understand what is happening. The goal is to give a intuitive visual representation of what is happening in the problem provided. PIPS can also be used as a basic physics model to look at how objects interact under a set of conditions.

This project has only just begun! Check out [the projects page](https://github.com/SPS-UCF/Python-Intro-Physics-Solver/projects) to see the list of things that have been completed, or that need to be done.

We also need people to play around with the project and break it. If you find something wrong with PIPS or have a suggestion on how to do something go to [the issues page](https://github.com/SPS-UCF/Python-Intro-Physics-Solver/issues) and create a new issue about it. All feedback is welcome!

## Audience
The targeted audience for PIPS are the people who are interested in visualizing the kinematics or electricity/magnetism problem they are working on. It should be known that you aren't expected to know how to program in python, only to launch a python application.
